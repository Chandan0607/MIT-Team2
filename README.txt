The code has been written in Python and the IDE used is VS Code/Pycharm.
We used Tkinter to design the UX/UI and python inbuilt libraries to achieve the results.

1.Python tuples are a data structure that store an ordered sequence of values. Tuples are immutable. 
This means you cannot change the values in a tuple. 
Tuples are defined with parenthesis.
2.Python | Pandas DataFrame
Pandas DataFrame is two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).
 A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
Pandas DataFrame consists of three principal components, the data, rows, and columns.
3.Python | Introduction to Matplotlib
Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. 
Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. 
It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.
One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. 
Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.
4.The New API
This repository, matplotlib/mplfinance, contains a new matplotlib finance API that makes it easier to create financial plots.
 It interfaces nicely with Pandas DataFrames.
